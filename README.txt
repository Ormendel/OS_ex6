Overall: DESIGN PATTERNS

Compile with "make" or "make all".

For questions 1-3 open 2 terminals:
The first terminal will be the server - run by ./main1.
The second terminal will be the client - run by ./client 127.0.0.1

For question 4 run by ./guardtest
In this question we updated a global variable using 2 threads.

For question 5 run by ./singleton

For question 6 we didn't have enough time to implement pollServer and pollClient :(

If we only had more time like Dumbledore said: "3 turns should do it" .
